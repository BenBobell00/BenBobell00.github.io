Cinema and TV are both profoundly beautiful media. Each synthesizes many unique artistic talents to create a stunning and seamless whole. 
I want to share some of my favorite films and shows with you. I am including anything I have rated an 8/10 or above on IMDB (or 4/5 on Letterboxd.
I hope you appreciate them and learn a little bit about my artistic tastes in the process. I will link my Letterboxd for a more updated list: https://letterboxd.com/benbobell/
