I love music. I began performing Renaissance music in high school in my madrigal choir. As I grew older, my tastes solidified.
I began to discover the beauties of both medieval music and minimalism. Through their simplicity, they bring such melodic beauty.
I of course love all eras of music (except for the classical era, which I find to be a tad boring). 
I would love to share some of my favorite pieces from each era with you.
