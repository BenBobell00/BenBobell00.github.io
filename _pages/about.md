I am a graduate student in Mathematical Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, working jointly with Rahul Nandkishore and Andy Lucas. My interests broadly come in two flavors: exotic or extremal behavior in complex systems and learning under fundamental uncertainty and randomness. For the former, I understand how complicated many-body quantum systems can demonstrate novel dynamical and emergent phenomena when out-of-equilibrium. For the latter, I am interested in both classical and quantum information theory more broadly. These flavors shape my overall taste in mathematics â€” very little is more beautiful than probability theory and functional analysis. 

Outside of Mathematics and Physics, I am very interested in the philosophy of science, epistemology, and metaethics. What governs a good theory? To what degree is science well-founded? What does quantum mechanics actually mean?
