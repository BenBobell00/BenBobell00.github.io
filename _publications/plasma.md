A nonlinear effect, RF (radio frequency) condensation, can be used to facilitate RF stabilization of magnetic islands. Previously studied semi-analytical models for RF condensation are suited mainly for broad deposition profiles and are unable to handle power depositions that are localized in the interior of a magnetic island. The power deposition profile of electron cyclotron waves, in particular, can be highly localized near a cyclotron resonance. Here, a model is developed that can handle both localized profiles and broad profiles. This allows a comparison of RF condensation for narrow vs broad deposition profiles, and it allows a study of the dependence of RF condensation of localized deposition profiles on key parameters.
